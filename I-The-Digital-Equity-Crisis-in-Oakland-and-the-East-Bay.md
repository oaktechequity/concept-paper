I. The Digital Equity Crisis in Oakland and the East Bay

According to the Public Policy Institute of California, more than 20% of the people in the East Bay do not have access to Broadband in their homes (23.5% in Alameda County and 17.$% in Contra Cost County).  The people without Broadband access are disproportionately located in low-income neighborhoods.

In the fall of 2014, Get Connected! Oakland—a collaborative including the Oakland Unified School District, the City of Oakland, OTX West, East Bay Broadband Consortium (EBBC), California Emerging Technology Fund (CETF) among other participants—undertook a survey of Oakland students to determine how many had computers and high speed Internet at home.  

The survey substantiated what was already widely suspected.  It found that 14,000 students, largely living in lower income neighborhoods, did not have computers connected to high speed Internet at home.  That amounts to 11,000 homes and approximately 40% of the OUSD student population in regular public schools.  (It is an interesting coincidence that Oakland also has a 40% high school dropout rate.)   Most of these students live in the flatlands areas of Oakland with the highest rates of poverty.

Because of the emergence of “blended or personalized learning,” which is being embraced by School Districts throughout the East Bay and incorporates digital teaching and learning as an integral aspect of all education, students without access to computers connected to high speed Internet at home are in serious danger of falling farther and farther behind in school every day.

The survey is another indication of the widely recognized fact that there is a digital equity crisis in Oakland and the East Bay, which is also manifested in the relative lack of African American and Latino students participating in STEM courses, entering technology careers, obtaining jobs in Oakland, East Bay, and Bay Area tech companies, and launching tech start-ups.  This fact is particularly anomalous given the current Oakland, East Bay, and Bay Area tech boom.
