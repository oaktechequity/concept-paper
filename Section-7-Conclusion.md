**VII.  Conclusion**

Bridging the digital divide and eliminating the digital equity crisis in Oakland and the East Bay requires a whole integrated system, a tech ecology if you will, that low-income students, particularly students of color, can be assisted to enter, explore, and master.  The TechEquity Initiative seeks to weave the many pre-existing elements of such a tech ecology that already exist into the requisite whole system that will provide these students with the opportunity to:

*Obtain exposure to computers and the Internet.

*Acquire experience with the six basic career pathwaysâ€”coding; hardware and software support; digital media; digital office; web and social media; and engineering.

*Undertake life-relevant/career relevant education that, if appropriate, is linked to a tech career pathway leading to internships, part and full time jobs, and entrepreneurship.

Accomplishing this will be a victory for us all.
