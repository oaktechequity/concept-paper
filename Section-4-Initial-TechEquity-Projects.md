**IV. Initial TechEquity Projects**

EBBC is utilizing this strategic framework to guide TechEquity composed of a collaborative representatives from: tech-related education organizations; tech businesses and business support organizations; school districts and city and county governments; non-profits working with students and young people; philanthropic and corporate foundations; and media organizations.  

Four closely related projects are envisioned as the initial focuses for this TechEquity Initiative:

1. Organization of a **TechEquity Summit** to bring together the various programs and organizations engaged with these issues to share information, enhance collaboration, and encourage coordinated actions.  The groups working in this area tend to operate in silos.  Everyone would benefit from getting together, getting to know one another better, and identifying ways to work together.  In addition to presentations from these groups, conversations among them, and a discussion of the initial focuses for TechEquity, the Summit could explore and evolve ideas for a variety of additional projects.

2. Publishing of an on-line and hard copy **TechEquity Guide** promoting tech-related educational opportunities, including exposure to tech, tech-related experience, career exploration, mentoring, and intern, job, and entrepreneurship options.  It would be very useful to have a widely circulated easily usable Guide that describes the various programs and organizations that are providing tech-related education and that provides assistance to students in accessing the opportunities that are best suited to their individual needs.

3. Encouragement of the initiation and expansion of **tech-related afterschool and mentoring program**s for students in Oakland and other East Bay Cities.  After-school programs offer a relatively flexible way to launch and expand the full range of tech-related educational opportunities and all of the East Bay tech business are potential sources of tech mentors for East Bay students and young people.

For example, Piedmont has a wide range of tech-related education programs in its Rec Centers.  Oakland has none.  It would be very significant if the Oakland Fund for Children and Youth funded robust tech-related after school programs.  OTX West is installing new computer labs in all of Oaklandâ€™s Rec Centers and Boys and Girls Clubs.  This would be an optimal time to organize and launch a set of tech-related after-school programs in these centers in collaboration with some of the wide variety of tech-related education programs and organizations in Oakland. 

4. Promotion of **aggressive outreach to students** and young people to encourage them to join up with TechEquity and take full advantage of the opportunities for tech-related education, mentoring, internships, jobs, and entrepreneurship as outlined in the TechEquity Guide.  

East Bay school districts, cities, and counties, tech-related education organizations, non-profits and faith-based organizations that work with students and youth, and tech businesses with students and young people as some of their clientele all can be effective partners in an outreach campaign.
