**V. Structure and Roles**

Structure: The TechEquity Initiative will function as a collaborative made up of as many as possible of the organizations, businesses, and public agencies that are or could address the digital divide in the East Bay. The Initiative is being launched by an Organizing Committee made up of a representative selection of these organizations.  As TechEquity takes shape, this Organizing Committee will morph into an on-going Steering Committee. 

TechEquity is being launched with currently available resources and some modest additional funding.  However, as it grows the TechEquity Initiative will undertake a fundraising campaign with corporate and philanthropic foundations and on-line to raise funds for the Initiative as a whole and, perhaps, for the participating non-profits.

**Roles:**  It is expected that the roles among the members of the TechEquity collaborative will evolve, however, initially some of the roles are projected to be approximately as follows.

**East Bay Broadband Consortium (EBBC):**  EBBC is acting as convener of TechEquity as an aspect of its initiative to assist in bridging the digital divide in the East Bay.  EBBC will also provide some initial part time organizing staff and its fiscal agent, the Contra Costa Economic Partnership, can serve as initial fiscal agent for TechEquity.  

**OTX West:**  OTX West will utilize the Digital Inclusion Solution, which it has developed with EBBC and Comcast’s Internet Essentials, to provide very low-cost Broadband along with free computers, training, and tech support for students and families participating in TechEquity.  In addition, OTX West is installing new computer labs for all of the Oakland recreation Centers and Boys and Girls Clubs and these venues can become the sites for tech education programs in Oakland.

**Non-Profit Organizations Addressing the Digital Equity Crisis:**  The TechEquity Initiative will be an opportunity for the wide variety of tech-related educational organizations discussed in the relevant section of Appendix 1 and others to collaborate in creating the whole integrated system that is needed to resolve the digital equity crisis in Oakland and the East Bay and to get the benefits of scale in joint recruiting of students.  

**Oakland Unified School District and Other School Districts:**  Likewise, it is in the interest of OUSD and other school districts in the East Bay to embrace a TechEquity Initiative and see it as a way to assist its students to obtain computers and Internet connections, participate in blended and personalized learning in relation to reading and STEM, and explore the various tech-related career pathways.  OUSD and other school districts in the East Bay can encourage students to participate in TechEquity and facilitate incorporation of TechEquity programs in school site after school programs.  In Oakland, this will directly be of assistance to OUSD’s Linked Learning and Career Pathways initiative, supported by Measure N, the various tech-related academies, the West Oakland STEM Corridor, and other related projects.

**City of Oakland and Other East Bay Cities:**  A robust TechEquity Initiative offers many obvious benefits to students, families, and tech businesses in the City of Oakland and other East Bay cities. Hopefully, in Oakland, the Fund for Children and Youth will see the virtue of the TechEquity approach and provide support for the Initiative in general and the specific after school programs offered by different members of a TechEquity collaborative in particular.  TechEquity can be the source of tech-related after-school programs at Oakland Rec Centers and other after school venues in the East Bay, encourage the emergence of a diverse tech-related workforce for the tech industry in the East Bay, and contribute to the initiation of new indigenous East Bay-based tech-related businesses.

**Other Non-Profits:**  For the large number of non-profit educational organizations established to assist low-income youth, particularly youth of color, TechEquity can serve as an additional resource to help them accomplish their mission and, in turn, they can make appropriate referrals.

**East Bay Tech Businesses:**  TechEquity can help Oakland, East Bay, and Bay Area tech businesses to address their serious, widely acknowledged diversity problem.  Tech-related East Bay and Bay Area businesses and other businesses, chambers of commerce, and business organizations can: serve a co-sponsors of TechEquity and donate used computers to be refurbished and provided free to participating students and their families; encourage management and employees of businesses to volunteer as TechEquity mentors and as teachers in after-school programs; offer free or paid tech internships to TechEquity students and hire TechEquity graduates; and make financial donations to the TechEquity Initiative as a whole and to one or more of the collaborators in the TechEquity Initiative from their corporate foundations or corporate giving programs. 

**East Bay and Bay Area Philanthropic Foundations:**  TechEquity will provide East Bay and Bay Area philanthropic foundations and private donors with an opportunity to support a coordinated effort to address the digital equity crisis by supporting the TechEquity Initiative as a whole, the specific TechEquity projects, and several of the collaborators in the TechEquity Initiative.
