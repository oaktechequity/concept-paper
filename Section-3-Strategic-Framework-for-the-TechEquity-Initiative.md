**III. Strategic Framework for the TechEquity Initiative**

The strategic framework for this TechEquity Initiative is based on three core principles.

Access to Computers and High Speed Internet:  Access to computers connected to high speed Internet—in school, after school, and at home—is a prerequisite for participants in all of the tech-related programs described in Appendix 1 and a prerequisite for blended learning and personalized learning in relation to reading and STEM education and tech career pathway exploration.  


Six Basic Information Technology Career Pathways:  Information technology offers six basic types of career pathways:

Coding to produce software and apps.
Computer hardware and software support.
Digital media, including video, music, animation, and game design.
Digital office, including proficiency with word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and Power Point.
Web and social media, including website and social media design, maintenance, and utilization.
Engineering which includes developing proficiency in Autodesk-type products including AutoCAD, Inventor, and others.

From Exposure to Experience to Career Exploration to Career Acquisition:  For students to incorporate computers and high speed Internet fully in their learning and their lives and to come to see tech as a career possibility, they need to be connected with computers and high speed Internet at each stage of their education.

Pre K and Primary School: exposure to computers—mini-workstations if possible— and Internet in school, after school, and at home through blended learning and personalized learning in relation to reading, STEM, and appropriate social media and games.

Middle School: experience with computers—workstations with design and engineering capabilities if possible—and internet again in school, after school, and at home, continuing blended learning and personalized learning in relation to reading and STEM; engaging one or more of the six basic types of technology career pathways; and initiation of a career exploration to begin the process of connecting their education to a life plan.

High School: continuation of experience with computers and Internet for blended learning, personalized learning, and tech engagement with the addition of focused career exploration and planning, linking education to a personally relevant career pathway and life plan (perhaps including enrollment in a tech academy) and to internships, part time jobs, and careers; also experience with learning on one’s own through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and other vehicles and, for those interested, incorporation of entrepreneurship education and experience with business start-ups.

Higher Education: receipt of a lap top computer on graduation from high school, career preparation through engagement with tech-related higher education in community colleges and four year institutions, and on-going support from programs like JUMA, BUILD, College Track and other support programs.

After Graduation from High School or College: career acquisition through job placement help from the various workforce assistance organizations, mentorship once a job has been acquired, or tech entrepreneurship assistance from various business incubation and acceleration organizations.
