**Appendix 1: A Listing of Organizations Addressing the Digital Equity Crisis**

This Appendix provides a listing of some of the organizations and programs that are involved or could be involved in addressing the digital equity crisis in Oakland and the East Bay.  Right now the list is Oakland-centric because that is where the idea for TechEquity originated, but the list will be expanded to include the relevant organizations located in other cities as the Initiative develops. It is a pretty long list in relation to Oakland-based organizations already, but certainly still has many gaps and omissions (for which we apologize) that will be filled in over time.  Among other things, a TechEquity Guide could include expanded descriptions of these organizations and the programs they offer.  

The presentation of Cedric Brown, Managing Partner of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, The Oakland Tech Pipeline, given at The Oakland Summit on Blacks in Tech 2015, offers an excellent graphic representation of many of these programs and organizations and their relationships.  http://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Brown-oakland-tech-pipeline-osbit2015.pdf
