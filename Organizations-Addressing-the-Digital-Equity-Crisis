**II. Organizations Addressing the Digital Equity Crisis**

However, there are very many organizations and programs in Oakland and the East Bay that are directly or indirectly addressing different aspects of the digital equity crisis or are very relevant to its resolution, including:

* A large number of tech-related non-profit education organizations.
* The Oakland Unified School District and other school districts.
* The City of Oakland and other cities in the East Bay.
* Alameda and Contra Costa Counties.
* Oakland, East Bay, and Bay Area tech businesses. 
* Bay Area based tech titans such as Google, Facebook and others.
* Oakland and East Bay business incubators, accelerators and business development organizations.
* Non-profits and faith-based organizations that work with Oakland and East Bay students and youth.
* Corporate and philanthropic foundations.
* Communications media organizations. 
 
(See Appendix 1 for a listing of many of these programs and organizations.)  

Each of these significant organizations, businesses, or institutions—essentially all elements in an emerging tech ecosystem—are responding to or could respond to one or more of the different aspects of the digital equity crisis in Oakland and the East Bay, but they are not well coordinated and integrated and they do not form a comprehensive, coherent citywide strategy.

In response to this situation, the East Bay Broadband Consortium (EBBC), a regional consortium organized to improve Broadband infrastructure and address the Digital Divide in the East Bay, is launching a TechEquity Initiative to develop and implement such a comprehensive, coherent, collaborative strategy.  With a primary initial focus on Oakland, EBBC will also undertake TechEquity in other cities in the East Bay.
