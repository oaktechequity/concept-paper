It is envisioned that Steps 1 through 4 can take place in the Summer and Fall of 2015 and Step 5, the first TechEquity Summit, can take place in late October or November of 2015.  Steps 6 through 9 can be completed in the first half of 2016, with a vigorous mobilization for summer school programs and the opening of the new school year in 2016.  This timeline may need to be pushed back and quality of execution is essential, however the level of the digital equity crisis in Oakland and the East Bay suggests that it would be important to try to move this fast.
